Text decoding and unicode support work around.
	-This is more of a Haxe problem. Doesn't like compiling with Unicode characters in string
	-Possible solution: Write bytes to data instead of to string
	-Possible solution: Use characters that are unused for special characters. Stuff like @ # $ % ^ & * can be used
		-$ can definitely be used for the pokedollar symbol to make that easier
		
NPC ZScript.
	- Take advantage of "user_[variable]" UDMF API for sending data to NPC actors
	- Use LANGUAGE lump to store specific NPC data, that way unique actors no longer need to be made per map
		- Store dialogue
		- Special scripts
		- Pokemon teams
		- Using LANGUAGE also means translations to other languages are possible! Bonus!
	-Add friends of crimes as easter eggs in battle tower as trainers
